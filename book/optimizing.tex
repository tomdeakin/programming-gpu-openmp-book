\chapter{Optimizing GPU code}

\section{GPU architecture overview}
\subsection{Case studies. Pick a specific GPU. Map high level abstraction of GPU device model to different real GPU hardware}
\subsection{Mapping of OpenMP constructs to GPUs}

%
% Tim:
% I found Wen Mei Hwu's approach to optmization extremely powerful.
% His book on CUDA was hugely impactful.  I sugesst we follow the same 
% approach.  I'll write up notes later
