\section{What is Heterogeneous computing and why everyone will be doing it}

\section{The basic building blocks of modern computing}
\begin{itemize}
\item  the CPU: the multiprocessor and cache coherent memory
\item  the SIMD or Vector Unit: lock-step execution across vector lanes
\item  the GPU:  Index space, kernels, work-items and work-groups
\end{itemize}

\section{Why you need OpenMP: a single code-base for heterogenous hardware}
