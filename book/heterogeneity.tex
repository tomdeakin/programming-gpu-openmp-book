\section{What is Heterogeneous computing and why everyone will be doing it}

\section{The basic building blocks of modern computing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce a set of standard processors.
\item  the CPU: the multiprocessor and cache coherent memory
\item  the SIMD or Vector Unit: lock-step execution across vector lanes
\item  the GPU:  Index space, kernels, work-items and work-groups
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduce Cache coherent shared memory machine. SMP model.}
Introduce what a standard CPU looks like. This is the host processor.

\subsection{Introduce GPU model}
Describe an abstract vendor-neutral GPU.
Using terms/definitions from OpenCL make this convenient.
Local memory, will use in Chapter~\ref{chapter:optimizing}.

In the book we will describe programming this GPU in OpenMP.
Later, we include case studies of how this applies to real hardware.


\section{Why you need OpenMP: a single code-base for heterogeneous hardware}
