\section{Quick crash course in OpenMP}
\subsection{Fork-join parallelism}
\subsection{Shared memory between threads}
\subsubsection{Data sharing clauses}
Need to be careful how we explain “shared memory” given the memory sharing rules between host/target we’ll introduce later.

\section{Example: serial to parallel vector add with stack arrays}
Example: vector add as the first example instead of pi (no reduction, so don’t need map clauses later).
Stack arrays are useful for the target parts, highlight data sharing clauses

\section{Example: serial to parallel pi}
Shows use of reduction clause
