\section{Unified shared memory}
\label{sec:usm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item OpenMP 5 add requires directive
  \item Which unified shared memory is.
  \item Data moves back and from at will (page fault).
  \item Requires hardware support.
  \item Pros: each to get started, as don't have to map.
  \item Cons: parallelism is the easy bit, it's the data movement which is important.
  \item In 5.0, limited performance tuning opportunities.
  \item Mapping gives you the control for optimal performance.
\end{itemize}
