\chapter{Others features in OpenMP 5.0 and beyond}
\label{chapter:future}

Features we should include, but don't follow the main narrative of the book.

\section{Multi-GPU with OpenMP}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Device clause.
    \item No worksharing with devices: need to manually decompose the work.
    \item Motivating example: AI?
\end{itemize}

\section{Declare target and the changes in 5.0.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compilers are now allowed to be smarter about figuring out if functions need a device version.
    \item Function calls.
    \item Libraries.
\end{itemize}

\section{Reverse offload.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Offload certain parts back to the host.
    \item Example: print, or file IO, or what about MPI?
    \item We could include this at end of \ref{chapter:target}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Memory allocators}
\begin{itemize}
    \item APIs for allocating Memory
    \item On the host, useful for allocating in specific regions
    \item Can allocate on the device.
    \item Alternative to map(alloc)
\end{itemize}


% Tom: not sure these are that relevant to GPU programming.
