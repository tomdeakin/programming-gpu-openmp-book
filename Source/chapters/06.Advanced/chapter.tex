\chapter{Advanced topics}

\section{Asynchronous offload}
\label{sec:async}

This chapter might be a good place for multi-GPU as will require a similar task-based approach.


\section{OpenMP tasking model and target regions as tasks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Very brief introduction to tasking.
  \item Target region is a task.
  \item Initial thread on host.
  \item Mergable included target task.
  \item Initial thread on device, encounters the parallelism.
  \item Undeferred, runs straight away.
\end{itemize}

\section{no wait clause}
\begin{itemize}
  \item nowait clause
  \item host continues execution
  \item waiting for tasks with taskwait
  \item simple depends clause
  \item Read Using OpenMP book.
\end{itemize}

\section{in reduction clause}
\label{sec:in_reduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item task reductions.
\end{itemize}

\section{if clause}
\label{sec:if_clause}
\begin{itemize}
  \item conditional offload
\end{itemize}

\section{Example: TBA}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Need something strong.
  \item File IO?
  \item MPI comms?
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi-GPU}

\section{Interop}
\label{sec:interop}
